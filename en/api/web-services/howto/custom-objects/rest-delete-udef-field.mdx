Describes how-to delete a Contact user-defined field details by prog-id or label. This deletes the admin version of the field. The layout needs to be published before the change is visible.

1. Delete the user-defined field:

    **Delete by ProgId**

    ```http
    DELETE https://\{\{env\}\}.superoffice.com/\{\{tenant\}\}/api/v1/Contact/UdefLayout/SuperOffice:11
    Authorization: Bearer \{\{token\}\}
    Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
    ```

    **Delete by FieldLabel**

    ```http
    DELETE https://\{\{env\}\}.superoffice.com/\{\{tenant\}\}/api/v1/Contact/UdefLayout/My New Number
    Authorization: Bearer \{\{token\}\}
    Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
    ```

1. Make sure the Contact user-defined fields are not currently being updated.

    ```http
    GET https://\{\{env\}\}.superoffice.com/\{\{tenant\}\}/api/v1/Contact/UdefLayout/Publish HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer \{\{token\}\}
    Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
    ```

    Only if the response is False, proceed to publish and complete the delete operation.

1. Publish to finalize the delete changes.

    ```http
    POST https://\{\{env\}\}.superoffice.com/\{\{tenant\}\}/api/v1/Contact/UdefLayout/Publish HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer \{\{token\}\}
    Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
    ```
