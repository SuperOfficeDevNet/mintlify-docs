# Automated tasks in Service

<SOMetadata deployment="onsite" />

In Service, several tasks are automated and run on a set schedule on the server. These tasks are carried out by the executables located in the *bin* folder of your Service installation.

Here, we cover the most used executables and how to debug them. In addition to the parameters provided for the executables, they all take the parameter `--help` to display more information.

If you want to store the output of running the executable in the command line to a file, add `>> <filename>` at the end of the command. Keep in mind that all output will be in the log file and will not be shown in the command prompt.

Example: `ejournalCron -maxdebug >> ejournalcronlog.txt`
