# Introduction to custom objects and fields

Custom objects are how a customer can either create new entities or extend existing entities inside SuperOffice, and are available in most search areas inside SuperOffice, including the API.

When an extra table is created, and has a field relation to a standard entity (Company, Contact, Sale, Project, Ticket), the new entity and all of its fields are available in the standard archives as available entities and columns. This makes it possible to create search selections for data stored in both built-in entity tables and extra tables, and combine them when relational fields exist. When an extra tables is marked as `Show table in Find` and contains a field pointing to a built-in entity, it is included as a top-level node in selections.

The [learn section][1] contains additional conceptual information and instructions for working with extra tables and custom fields in Settings and maintenance.
