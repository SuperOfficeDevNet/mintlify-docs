# Register an ERP and quote sync app

## About this template

This template creates an app configuration for a standard app and asks for the ERP Sync and Quote endpoint URLs. These may also be added at a later time.

* Enables the [WebApi][1] and [Services88][6] API endpoints
* Enable access to the [SystemToken claim][7]
* Enables access to the [ERPSync agent][5] and [Webhook agent][4]

## Standard app granted license

*Integration server* under licenses so the Sync / Quote panel is active in customer's Settings and Maintenance.

## Create app

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.

2. In the **Applications** section, click **Create App**.

3. Choose the **Standard ERP sync and quote app** template. Click **Next**.

4. Enter the name of your application. Click **Next**.

    <NoteAppName />

5. Enter the URL of the integration endpoints.

    Click Off/On to activate the endpoint.

    <Note>
    If the endpoint is not yet ready, you may change configuration later.
