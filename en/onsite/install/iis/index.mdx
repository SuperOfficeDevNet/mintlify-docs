# Prepare Web server

SuperOffice uses Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). This means WCF must be installed on the same server as the NetServer web services are installed.

## Preparing IIS for NetServer web services

<Tip>
See [system requirements][1].
</Tip>

### Make sure ASP.Net support is installed in IIS

**If not:**

1. Go to the Control Panel > Programs and click **Turn Windows features on or off**.

2. Then go to the **Role** for IIS and install ASP.Net support using **Add Role Services**.

### Make sure IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility is installed in the correct location

**IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility** must be installed under **IIS 6 Management Compatibility** under **Management Tools**. This is needed in the web installer to choose sites.

Plus any authentication methods that you wish to use.

<Note>
Forms authentication must not be used; we have made our own forms authentication.
</Note>

## For Service and Marketing the following features must be turned on

### Make sure CGI support is installed in IIS

**If not:**

1. Go to the Control Panel > Programs and click **Turn Windows features on or off**.

2. Then go to the **Role** for IIS and install CGI support using **Add Role Services**

3. Start **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

4. Click the server name and double click **ISAPI and CGI Restrictions**.

5. Click **Edit Feature Settings..** and check **Allow unspecified CGI modules**.

    If you do not want to **Allow unspecified CGI modules** it is also possible to use "Add..." to add each CGI file separately. This, however, requires you to make sure any new CGI files from Customer Service are added here.

6. Click **Add...**, navigate to the *[Service installation]\www\scripts* folder, and add one by one all .exe files in this folder. For each, write some description and tick **Allow extension path** to execute.
