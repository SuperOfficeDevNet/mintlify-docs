# Schedule repeating follow-up

<SOMetadata version="10.5" audience="person" />

To set up recurrence means to schedule the *start date* of follow-ups in a series. At the upper left of the dialog, the start date and time for the follow-up as well as the end time are displayed.

## Steps

1. [Open or create a follow-up][2].

1. Click <i class="ph ph-arrows-clockwise" aria-label="Repeat"></i> and select one of the suggested frequencies. If none of the patterns work for you, select **Custom**.

    If you do not see the icon, click **Show more**.

1. Update the start date if necessary.

1. Select a frequency, for example, repeat every 2 weeks. Additional options appear if you select *Week(s)*, *Month(s)*, or *Year(s)*.

1. Choose if the follow-up should stop after a specific number of times or after a specific date.

1. Optionally, fine-tune the list of selected dates, for example, if there is a conflict. Click a date, then use the buttons below the list to either remove or move that date.

1. Click **OK** to save the dates and return to the follow-up details.

1. Click **Save** in the **Follow-up** dialog to save all changes.
