description: "The **side panel** is a multifunctional tool located on the right side of every screen in SuperOffice CRM (except the Inbox). It provides quick access to relevant information and complements the main screen."
---

Use it to manage tasks, view overviews, or follow up on activities, sales, or contacts. The panel's content adapts based on the screen you are in, and it remembers your last view for each screen.

## Changing the side panel view

By default, the side panel shows a preview of the selected record. You can switch between different views in the side panel to display the information most relevant to your task.

For example, you can display the monthly calendar at the same time as you are viewing the daily calendar in the Diary screen, to give you a better overview, or you can show the members of a selection linked to a project you are looking at in the Project screen.

**Tip**

To quickly view other records without switching screens, click the arrow () next to the record's name in the side panel. This opens the [history list](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/learn/basics/history.html), where you can select a different record.

</Tip>

### Preview (default)

Shows a quick preview of selected records, such as contacts or activities, with links to related data. Clicking a link opens the respective dialog, such as the [Follow-up](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/diary/learn/create-follow-up.html) or [Document](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/document/learn/create.html#fields) dialog.

### Calendar views

Stay on top of your schedule with these views:

- **Day:** Agenda for today. Similar to the **Day** tab in the [Diary screen](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/diary/learn/index.html).
- **Next day:** Agenda for tomorrow.
- **Week:** Weekly overview of follow-ups.
- **Month:** Monthly calendar, with tooltips for activities and a "bar" indicator for daily workload. Expand the side panel to show multiple months.

You can navigate between dates, weeks, or months using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons () at the bottom of the side panel.

When you are in the **Diary** screen, navigating to a different week or month in the side panel will also update the Diary view. Similarly, selecting a date, week, or month in the Diary updates the side panel to reflect the change.

<Note>
**Note**

Only your own diary can be shown in the side panel. Use the **Diary** screen to view others' calendars.
