# Upgrade to SuperOffice 11

<SOMetadata version="11" deployment="onsite" />

You can upgrade to SuperOffice 11 from SuperOffice 8.0 or newer. The recommended installation scenarios and setup requirements are the same as from SuperOffice 8.1.

<WarnWinClientDiscontinued />

## Upgrade from SuperOffice 8.0

If you are running SuperOffice 8.0, you need to make sure the full stack of SuperOffice applications (SuperOffice Server, SuperOffice Web, and SuperOffice Service) is installed. You also need to [move all products under one domain][1], as seen from the browser. It might be beneficial to [upgrade to SuperOffice 8.1][1] first and follow the corresponding guides for different installation scenarios.

## Upgrade from SuperOffice 8.1 or newer

A SuperOffice 8.1 or newer installation already has the full stack of SuperOffice applications installed, and it is running under one domain, which makes it easier to upgrade.

### 1. Upgrade SuperOffice Server

From SuperOffice 11, the SuperOffice server and database are upgraded with [CrmSetup][2] utility.

Run CrmSetup.exe with `upgrade-existing` option and supply the corresponding argument file, see an example below. This will upgrade the database to the current version.

```dos
D:\SO Onsite 11.6\CrmSetup>CrmSetup.exe upgrade-existing --arg-file CRMSetupUpgrade.txt
2025-11-18 12:40:44 [Info] Found a SuperOfficeCdd database
2025-11-18 12:40:44 [Info] Validating license for Super 85 with serial number 1010000006
2025-11-18 12:40:45 [Info] No pending upgrades
2025-11-18 12:40:45 [Info] Copying embedded document template resources
2025-11-18 12:40:45 [Info] Starting NetServer
2025-11-18 12:40:48 [Info] Perform tasks after upgrade
Upgrade completed successfully
```

Example argument file for upgrade:

```dos
# crmsetup --arg-file CRMSetupUpgrade.txt

<SOMetadata version="11" deployment="onsite" />
# replace the values

<SOMetadata version="11" deployment="onsite" />
upgrade-existing
--database-server SQL-server
--database-name SO85
--db-user crm7
--db-password xxx
--table-prefix crm7
--so-arc C:\soserver\SO_ARC
--email-client Outlook2007
--company-name Super 85
--serial-number 161xxxxxxx
--license-url https://license.superoffice.com/LicenseSvc/LicenseService.svc
--system-user crm8
--system-password xxx
--language NO
--country NO
```

### 2. Upgrade SuperOffice Web

To upgrade SuperOffice Web, run *Setup.exe* from *SnMWeb* installation file. The setup can upgrade both NetServer and SuperOffice Web files.

<RemoteNetserverWeb />

### 3. Upgrade SuperOffice Service

To upgrade SuperOffice Service, run the *SuperOffice.CustomerService.exe* file from the *CS* installation folder. After the Service program files are upgraded you need to run *upgrade.exe* to upgrade Service's database values.

### 4. Uninstall SuperOffice 8 Win clients

The SuperOffice Win app has been discontinued since SuperOffice 9. If you used the SuperOffice 8 Win app, it needs to be uninstalled from all clients.
