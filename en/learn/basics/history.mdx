description: "In several places in SuperOffice CRM, the history list makes it easy to access the last items you looked at. The history list contains companies, contacts, sales, selections or projects you have previously worked with. The number of records displayed in the history list is defined under Preferences."

You can use the history list in different ways:

- Directly from the Navigator to go to the required company, contact, sale, project or selection.
- From dialogs containing the fields for companies, contacts, sales and projects, for example, the **Follow-up** and **Document** dialogs, to link to the follow-up or document.
