* **Email signature:** The template contains variables for your name, company, address, phone numbers, email address, website, and so on [from your contact card](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/document/templates/variables/for-selected-contact.html).
* **Request signature:** The template contains variables for your name, company, email address, and so on specific to [reply templates](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/knowledge-base/learn/reply-templates/template-variables.html).

<Note>
**Note**

You cannot mix these two sets of template variables. Additionally, personal signatures cannot be overridden by admins.
