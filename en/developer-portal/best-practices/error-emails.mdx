# Error reporting emails

SuperOffice will also send you emails when there is a problem with your application or someone wish to uninstall it. By default, these emails go to the technical contact of the application. However, you can also specify a list of addresses for error reporting and uninstall.

## ERP sync, quote, and mirroring

For each endpoint you have configured SuperOffice to send data to, you can also subscribe to error emails.

To turn off/on error emails to the technical contact for an endpoint, update the integration settings configuration of the application.

* [ERP sync][5]
* [Quote connector][6]
* [Database mirror][4]

To receive error emails at different or more than one email addresses, update the application settings:

1. On the app page, select **Settings** from the left menu or click the **Edit** button.

1. Scroll to **Error reporting emails**.

1. Enter one or more email addresses, then press Enter after each one to add them to the list.

1. Click **Save Settings**.

<Note>
You can update the email addresses in the application settings at any time. Technical contact will receive any notification mail if this field is blank.
</Note>

## Uninstall reporting emails

To receive notifications when an app uninstall request is submitted, update the **Uninstall reporting emails** field in the application settings.

1. On the app page, select **Settings** from the left menu or click the **Edit** button.
2. Scroll to **Uninstall reporting emails**.
3. Enter one or more email addresses, then press **Enter** after each one to add them to the list.
4. Click **Save Settings**.

<Note>
If app's list is blank, uninstall notifications will be sent to the partner's **Uninstall reporting emails** list.

If both lists are blank, uninstall notifications will be sent to the partner's **administrative contact**.
</Note>

## Other errors

For other errors, such as when a customer reports a problem from the App Store, the technical contact will be notified if error reporting emails field is empty.
