## Filter by customer

* To see the impact of your app on one specific customer (tenant), select a customer from the drop-down list.

    <Note>
    The list contains only the [customers that have authorized the app][1] for a specific environment. For example, a SOD tenant appears only in the SOD environment. If you don't see a customer you think should be in the list, check that you have selected the correct environment.
    </Note>

* To clear the filter, click the red cross.

## Improve app performance

<ImprovePerformance />

The default time period when you look at API calls is **Months**, but you can change the resolution on the horizontal axis to **Weeks** or **Days**.

During development, following the statistics in SOD day-by-day can provide valuable insight into the impact of your improvements.
