# Create a SuperOffice CRM new trigger

Use a **new trigger** when you want your Zap to start whenever a new record is created in SuperOffice CRM.

Each record type (such as Sale, Contact, or Project) has its own trigger event.

Use the tabs below to view the specific steps and screenshots for each trigger type. All other steps on this page are identical for every event.

## Steps

1. On the Zaps page, click **Create**.

1. Click the **Trigger** step to open a window for selecting the application to use.
