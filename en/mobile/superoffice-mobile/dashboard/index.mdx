You can drill down from dashboard tiles to explore the data behind a chart, number, or list-just like in the web client.

### View data

    * **Chart:** Tap once to select a segment, then tap again to open the details. These tiles visualize data.
    * **Big number:** Tap the number to view related records. These tiles show aggregate metrics or KPIs.
    * **List:** Tap a list item to open it. These tiles represent defined selections.

### Supported entities

You can drill down into the following entities:

* Appointment
* Company
* Contact
* Document
* Project
* Request
* Sale

**Not supported in Mobile CRM:**

* Product
* Quote lines
* Mailings
