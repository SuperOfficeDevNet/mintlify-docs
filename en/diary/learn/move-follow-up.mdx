# Move a follow-up

<NoteEditFollowup />

At some time, you will undoubtedly need to move follow-ups from one time slot to another, from the activities list to the Diary screen, or from the Diary screen to the activities list. These actions can be accomplished quickly and easily in SuperOffice CRM by dragging and dropping with the mouse.

<Note>
You can move only one follow-up at a time, and only follow-ups that are not completed. [How to change Completed status of an activity][1].
</Note>

## Move to a different time or day

1. Select the required tab in the Diary screen (**Day**, **Week**, **Month**, or **View**).

2. Drag and drop the required follow-up to a different time.

<Tip>
You can check the time and duration for a follow-up by holding the mouse pointer over it in the Diary screen. This displays a tooltip containing information about the follow-up.
</Tip>

## Move from one week or month to another

* Select the **Week** or **Month** view in the side panel, go to the required week or month and then drag the follow-up from the Diary to the required day in the side panel. The diary automatically updates with the required week or month.

* Move the follow-up temporarily to the activities list, go to the required week or month and then drag the follow-up back to the required day in the Diary.

    <Note>
    You cannot move a meeting with attendees to the activities list.
    </Note>

## Move from the activities list to the Diary

You can move a follow-up from the activities list to the Diary. This can be useful if you moved a follow-up from the Diary to the activities list and want it back in the Diary, for example, on a different date.

1. Select the required tab in the Diary screen (**Day**, **Week**, **Month**, or **View**).

2. Grab the follow-up in the activities list by clicking down on it with the mouse button.

3. Drag the follow-up to the required time and/or day in the Diary and release the mouse button. The follow-up is entered in the Diary. It is removed from the [activities list][2] if the criteria for inclusion in the activities list are no longer fulfilled.

<Tip>
Select the **Week** or **Month** view in the side panel, go to the required week or month in the Diary and then drag the follow-up from the Diary to the required day in the side panel. The diary automatically updates with the required week or month.
</Tip>

If you entered a follow-up in the Diary but are not yet sure of the time or date to allocate to it, you can enter it in the activities list temporarily. Move the follow-up from the Diary to the activities list using drag and drop.
