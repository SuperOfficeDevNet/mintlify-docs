# Application configuration

## Get keys

If you have registered the application but lost the keys, you need to [look up your ID][7] and [create a new secret][8].

## Authentication

* [Check what your client ID is][7]
* [Create a new client secret][8]
* [Add a certificate][10]
* [About user contexts][4]

<Caution>
SuperOffice doesn't store the **client secret and certificate private key** in the database. When you create a new secret or certificate, copy and store this information. You can't go back and look it up in the Developer Portal later.
</Caution>
