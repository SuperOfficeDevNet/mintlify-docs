## Relationships

| Table|  Description |
|------|-------------|
|[associate](./associate)  |Employees, resources and other users - except for External persons |
|[document](./document)  |Documents, this table is an extension of the Appointment table.  There is always a corresponding appointment record; the relation between appointment and document is navigable in both directions. A document-type appointment record always has a corresponding document record and a record in VisibleFor specifying who may see this.   |
|[QuoteAlternative](./quotealternative)  |Quote Version is made up of one or more Alternatives. One of 1..n possible alternatives in a Quote Version. The reason we have alternatives is that a quote can say to a customer, "we can solve you problem in two (or more) different ways, with different technology and sideeffects (and price)". An Alternative may have discounts on the total amount. The Alternative tracks whether the user on the order level entered the Discount , Earning amount or the TotalPrice fields so that the discount and earning and total can be re-calculated correctly when Quote Lines are added or changed. |
|[QuoteConnection](./quoteconnection)  |Primary key in the CRM database. Definition of a connection to an external system, for the Quote system. |
|[QuoteVersion](./quoteversion)  |There may be multiple Versions of a Quote, with one of them active |
|[sale](./sale)  |Sales  For every Sale record edited through the SuperOffice GUI, a copy of the current version of the record will be saved in the SaleHist table. This also applies to editing done through the SaleModel COM interface, but not to editing done through the OLE DB Provider or other channels.   |
