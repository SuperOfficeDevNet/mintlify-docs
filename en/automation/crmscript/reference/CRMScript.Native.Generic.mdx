# Generic

Generic is the base type of all other intrinsic CRMScript data types. Any variable can be up-casted to Generic.

There's a close connection between Generic and structs.

simpler iteration of variables (struct members); easier to access and set new variables in structs; possible to change which variables are members without having to hard-code each field.

## Constructors

### Generic()

```crmscript
Generic
```

Initializes a new instance of the Generic class.
