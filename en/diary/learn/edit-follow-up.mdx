# Edit follow-up

<NoteEditFollowup />

If you edit the time, date, or location of a follow-up - or delete an invitation that you created and sent - the invitees will receive a message about this.

## Steps

1. Open an existing follow-up by double-clicking it:

    * In the **Activities** section tab in the Company, Contact, Diary, Project, or Sale screen.
    * Or, on the different tabs in the Diary screen.

2. [Make the required changes in the dialog.][3]

    <NoteRepetition />

3. Click **Save**.

<Note>
You cannot edit completed follow-ups until you have undone their **Completed** status.
</Note>

## <a id="change-end"></a>Change the end time for a follow-up in the Diary

In the Diary screen, you can change the end time for a follow-up without having to open it:

1. Click the follow-up in the **Day** tab, **Week** tab, or **View** tab.

1. Hover the mouse pointer over the lower edge of the follow-up. The pointer changes to a double arrow.

1. Click and hold, then drag the lower edge up or down to adjust the duration of the follow-up. The updated end time is displayed as you drag.

1. Release the mouse button to apply the change.

<Note>
You can also change the time slot by opening the follow-up and changing the **Start**, **End**, **Due**, or **Duration** fields.
</Note>

## <a id="repeat"></a>Edit repeating follow-up

Changes work in the same way as when you edit follow-ups, but when you make a change, the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog appears.

* If you select **Change only this instance**, the change will not affect other times.

* If you select **Change all future instances including this one**, the change will apply to this follow-up and all repetitions in the future as well.

You can change only the start date for the follow-up while viewing the recurrence details. To change the time, click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the follow-up details.

If you decide to change the rule in the middle of a series of meetings, then a new rule is created, and the old rule is stopped at the point where the break occurs.

If you change the start time for a single meeting, the rule is not affected. The meeting is treated as an exception to the rule. The exception can be made un-exceptional by moving it back into line with the other meetings.

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete follow-up using the Diary

* If you delete a follow-up you are invited to, the follow-up is removed from your Diary only.
* If you Delete an invitation that you own from your Diary, this follow-up also disappears from the invitees' diaries.

1. Select the required follow-up.
1. Right-click and choose **Delete**.
1. Choose **Yes** to confirm the deletion or **No** to keep the follow-up in the confirmation dialog.
