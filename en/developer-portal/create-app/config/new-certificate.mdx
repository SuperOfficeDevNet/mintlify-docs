# New certificate

The certificates in your application configuration are **RSA encryption keys**. You need the private key to [sign system user tokens][2] in server-to-server applications and database mirroring.

The Developer Portal stores your public key. However, you must store the private key.

## How to

<GoToAppPage />
2. Select **Configuration** > **Authentication**.

3. Click **New Certificate**.

4. Enter a description and expiration, and then click **Add**.

    ![Certificates -screenshot][img3]

    <NoteExpiration />

5. Store the **private key** somewhere safe! You can't look it up in the Developer Portal later.

6. Click **Save Settings**.

    * If the new certificate is for **SOD only:** No further action is needed.
    * If the certificate is for **stage, production, or all environments:** You must request publishing.
