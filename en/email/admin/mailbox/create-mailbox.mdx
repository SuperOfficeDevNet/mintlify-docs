# Create mailboxes

You can create a mailbox to use for importing email into SuperOffice Service. Before you do that, you must create a mailbox on the mail server that the email is delivered to.

<Note>
Before you set up a mailbox, make sure that there are no old messages in this mailbox on the mail server. SuperOffice Service will import all mail in the mailbox and you risk sending auto-replies to all contacts who have sent email to this address. To import these old emails, you should disable the auto-reply function. Above all, this concerns the **Do not auto-reply** option in the **Mailbox properties** screen and the **Do not send email to new contacts** option in the **Settings** tab in the **System** screen in SuperOffice Service.
</Note>
