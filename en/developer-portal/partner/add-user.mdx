# Add a user

<DefDpUser />

You can view the users already added on your partner page.

This task requires **User management** permission.

## [Partner Admin](#tab/partner-admin)

### Who can I add?

You can add any known user by name or email address that shares one or more tenants with you **in production**. You can't add users that don't share a tenant with you. If you want to add a user that doesn't share a tenant with you, you must first add the user to your tenant by creating a new user in the target SuperOffice instance [Settings and maintenance][3].

* If it matches an existing [SuperID][2] user account, select and add the user to the partner. If you know this user is a SuperOffice CRM Online user, make sure you use the correct UPN - `firstname@company.com` versus `firstname.lastname@company.com`
* If the search results are empty, ensure the **active user** belongs to at least one of your shared tenants **in production**. If not, you can't add them to your partner.

### How to

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Users** from the left menu.
3. Click **Add User** button.

4. Enter a valid name or email address, then select the user from the list.

5. Selected the user from the list, then click **Add**.

6. The user is added to the Partner Users collection.

7. You can now [assign permissions][1].

## [DevPortal Admins](#tab/devportal-admin)

### Who can I add?

You can assign a known user or create a new one. In both cases, you look up an email address.

* If it matches an existing [SuperID][2] user account **in production**, all you have to do is to assign it to the partner. If you know this user is a SuperOffice CRM Online user, make sure you use the correct UPN - `firstname@company.com` versus `firstname.lastname@company.com`
* If the address is unknown, you can fill in a form to create a new user. This person becomes both a SuperID user and a portal user.

### How to

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Users** from the left menu.
3. Click **Create User**.
4. Enter a valid email address and click **Find user by email**.

    ![Find user by email in the SuperOffice Developer Portal -screenshot][img2]

5. Either assign a known user or create a new one.

    For known SuperID users, click **Assign to Partner**.

    If the user is unknown:

    1. Click **Create User**.

    2. Fill in the form.
