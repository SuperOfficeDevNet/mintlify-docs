# Validation checklist

My custom application is ready, what should I consider before I ask for a validation test?

## Development Tools subscription

Access to a customer's tenant from a custom application requires an active [Development Tools subscription][1] license. The license is purchased by the customer.

If the subscription is discontinued, any custom applications will lose access to that tenant.

## Security

<SecurityChecklist />

## Provisioning

<ExplicitConsent />
Custom apps therefore do not need to implement the [workflow for giving consent][2].

## Error handling

* The application handles scenarios where access to the customer's database is lost, such as during our maintenance windows. Check the [tenant status page][3]

## Limit your searches

* API calls don't choke the database, see [best practices][5]
* Ensure the user types at least 3 characters before you start searching for contacts, persons, email addresses, selections, and similar
* No more than 10 API calls per second

## Protect your web panels

<ProtectWebpanels />

<UsecForbiddenOnline />

## System user and important rules

* Never rename the **owner company** (`contact.name` field for the company with `contact_id` found in the Company database table). If you do, our license check fails and all users are locked out!
* Persons may be associates - if they have a row in the associate table then
  * don't update a person's company (`person.contact_id`)

<ProtectDatabase />

## Maintenance window

* You will handle unavailability scenarios such as when CRM Online is not available

## I'm good to go!
