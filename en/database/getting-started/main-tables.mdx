# The main tables

The main tables in the system are:

| Table | Contains |
|---|---|
| [Contact][1] | The companies |
| [Person][2] | The contact persons |
| [Associate][3] | The users - these are linked to contact persons |
| [Appointment][4] | Meetings, to-do activities |
| [Document][5] | Document activities |
| [Sale][6] | Sale activities |
| [Project][7] | Projects |
| [ProjectMember][8] | Persons who are part of a project |
| [Selection][9] | Selections |
| [SelectionMember][10] | Link table for Contact+Person who are selection members |
| [Ticket][11] | Service tickets |

<Note>
The [Company][12] table is used to store the ID of the company that owns the license. It has nothing to do with the company display in the user interface.
</Note>

Unfortunately, not all table names and UI labels match. If in doubt, [refer to our mapping][13].
